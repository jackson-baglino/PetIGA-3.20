## 2026-04-23 — Propagate stability-triggered sediment freeze to all opts files

- Added `-sed_freeze_tol 1.0e-3` to all 17 `.opts` files in `inputs/tests/` to make the default explicit.
- Raised `-nsteps_sed` from 10/45 → 200 on long production runs with ice-sed contact (1D/2D IceSlab, EnclosedGrainPair, IceCap, CapillaryBridge, ContactSedPair, T05, T11, T12); quick 10-20 step regression tests and no-sediment flat-interface tests keep `nsteps_sed 10`.
- Changed `test3_relax.opts` to `flag_sed_mode -1` (never freeze), consistent with its purpose of studying unrestricted 3-phase relaxation.

## 2026-04-23 — Fix phase-variable mismatch: always-3-phase ice equation with gated sediment penalty

- Root cause identified: the old code changed **both** the ice equation and added a sediment penalty when `flag_sed_frozen` fired. This created an equilibrium discontinuity — the 3-phase ice equilibrium is incompatible with the 2-phase ice equation, causing spurious air and negative ice at the ice-sediment interface.
- Fix in `assembly.c`: widened `else if (flag_sed_frozen == 0)` to a plain `else` so the 3-phase ice equation is always used. The sediment penalty `R_sed += k_sed*(sed-sed0)*N0[a]` is now gated on `flag_sed_frozen` inside the 3-phase branch — it activates when sediment needs pinning but never changes the ice residual form.
- Deprecated 2-phase ice branch preserved as a commented block with explanation of why it must not be restored.
- Fixed stale comment in `permafrost2.c`: default `k_sed_pen` is `1e-7/eps²`, not `1e-3/eps²`.
- Updated `test_2D_IceSlab.opts`: changed `flag_sed_mode 0` (always-frozen, no relaxation) to `flag_sed_mode 1` (10-step free relaxation before penalty activates).
- This change also addresses vanishing sediment and grain sintering in 3-phase mode: once the penalty activates, each grain is pinned near its initial shape (`sed0`), preventing Gibbs-Thomson shrinkage and grain-grain merging.

## 2026-04-23 — flag_sed_mode CLI option and 2-phase sediment drift fix

- Added `-flag_sed_mode` to `AppCtx` and registered as a PETSc CLI option: `-1` = always 3-phase, `0` = always 2-phase, `1` (default) = switch after `nsteps_sed` steps.
- Changed default `nsteps_sed` from 0 to 10 so mode 1 runs 10 relaxation steps before freezing sediment.
- Fixed sediment drift bug in 2-phase mode (`assembly.c`): the 2-phase `R_sed` branch was missing the `k_sed*(sed-sed0)*N0[a]` restoring penalty, allowing numerical drift through SNES tolerance.
- Updated `monitoring.c` freeze logic to only trigger when `flag_sed_mode == 1` (previously always triggered when `nsteps_sed > 0`, which prevented mode -1 from working).
- Added `-nsteps_sed 10` and `-flag_sed_mode 1` to all 17 `.opts` files in `inputs/tests/`.

## 2026-04-22 — Penalty parameter tuning framework

- Exposed `difvap_pen`, `k_pen`, and `k_sed_pen` as PETSc CLI options so parameter sweeps no longer require recompilation; defaults unchanged.
- Added `scripts/tune_vapor_penalty.py`: sweeps `difvap_pen` and `k_pen` independently; measures rhov drift, sublimation rate, SNES iters, in-ice rhov error; outputs CSV + PNG.
- Added `scripts/tune_sed_penalty.py`: sweeps `k_sed_pen` prefactor over 7 decades; measures sediment drift, spatial shape error, SNES iters; outputs CSV + PNG.

## 2026-04-22 — 2D ice slab IC and improved 1D plotting

- Added `FormInitialIceSlab2D` in `src/initial_conditions.c`: 2D equivalent of the 1D centered-slab IC (flag_tIC=0), using tanh profiles in x uniform across Ly.
- Registered `ic_type = "ice_slab"` in `src/permafrost2.c` and declared in `include/initial_conditions.h`.
- Created `inputs/tests/test_2D_IceSlab.opts`: thin 2D domain (114×23 nodes, Lx=1e-4 m, Ly=2e-5 m) matching the 1D slab parameters.
- Updated `postprocess/plot1D_profiles.py`: added dashed black sum-of-phases line (φ_i+φ_s+φ_a) to per-step phase plots as a partition-of-unity diagnostic.
- Added `plot_thermal_steps()` in plotting script: saves per-step T(x) and ρ_v(x) figures on individual subplots to `thermal_steps/` directory, running alongside phase images by default.

## 2026-04-22 — Interface relaxation analysis for test3_EnclosedGrainPair

- Created `inputs/tests/test3_relax.opts`: copy of test3 with `nsteps_sed=0` and `t_final=100000` to run full 3-phase relaxation without sediment freezing.
- Ran simulation (125 steps, t=0–100,409 s) to generate `relax_monitor.dat` with uninterrupted sediment evolution.
- Analysis finding: `AssemblePhase_reinit.dat` IC is already fully relaxed — per-step changes in `ice_air_interf` and `ice_sed_interf` are <1e-7 from step 0, well below the 1e-3 threshold. Sediment freezing at `nsteps_sed=60` was overly conservative; sediment degrades numerically past ~step 100 (ice-sed interface drops to 6% of initial by step 124 without freezing).
- Updated `nsteps_sed` in `test3_EnclosedGrainPair.opts`: 60 → 10 (safe conservative buffer, no performance penalty).
- Enhanced `scripts/plot_relax.py` with `--slideshow`, `--outdir`, `--fmt` flags; generates 5 separate 16:9 high-DPI PNG files for slideshow use (combined, normalized, rate, early-zoom, physical-time axis); switched to `constrained_layout` to fix `twiny` compatibility.
- Saved 5 slideshow plots to `SimulationResults/.../test3_relax_.../relax_plots/`.

## 2026-04-20 — Add contact_sed IC and T18/T19 tests; Mobility refactor; 17/17 pass

- Replaced `MobilitySub` with `Mobility` (Hermite-interpolated blending of ice/sed/air mobilities); added `mob_air` to AppCtx.
- Renamed parameter `met` → `sed` and `Fwat` → `Fsed` throughout headers and material_properties.c.
- Removed dead `mob_sed` variable and commented-out `flag_Tdep` mobility block from assembly.c.
- Added `FormInitialContactSedPermafrost2D`: two sediment grains just touching, each with a concentric ice shell; fixed SNES divergence at contact point by switching from additive sum to min-distance tanh union.
- Changed `gamma_im` 0.33→0.07; set `mob_sed = mob_air = mob_sub` so all phases share equal mobility by default.
- Added `test4_ContactSedPair.opts` (long run) and `test_T18_contact_sed_quick.opts` (10-step smoke run).
- Added T18 (2D contact-sed smoke) and T19 (2D IC accuracy with lens-area corrected expected ice volume); all 17/17 tests pass.

## 2026-04-19 — Extend test suite to T11–T17 (15/15 pass)

- Added T11 (sublimation deceleration in finite domain), T12 (deposition at hum=1.5), T13 (temperature field consistency), T16 (mass conservation), T17 (Dirichlet temperature BC fix).
- Created 3 new opts files: `test_T11_sublim_rate.opts` (1000 steps), `test_T12_deposition.opts` (hum=1.5), `test_T17_temp_bc.opts` (flag_BC_Tfix=1).
- T11/T13/T16 share a single 1000-step sublimation run; T12 and T17 each have dedicated runs.
- Diagnosed `temp` monitor column as ∫T dx [°C·m], not domain-average — fixed T13/T17 criteria accordingly.
- Discovered and documented finite-domain vapour depletion: sublimation rate drops 21× over 0.1 s as accumulated vapour quenches the driving force.
- Updated `test/TEST_ANALYSIS.md` with full descriptions for T11–T17, updated cross-test analysis and parameter tables.
- All 15/15 tests pass.

## 2026-04-18 — Systematic test suite (T01–T10), all 10 pass

- Rewrote `preprocess/comp_eps.py`: added `compute_params()`, `rho_vs_sat()`, `patch_opts()`, and full CLI (`--patch`, `--quiet`); eps and Nx now computed from domain geometry and Kaempfer & Plapp bounds.
- Patched all 5 test opts files with `eps=9.3295e-07`, `Nx=152`.
- Fixed `test/run_tests.py`: corrected `_parse_monitor()` regex to reject 14-column SNES DOF rows, fixed `rho_vs()` to match C ASHRAE polynomial, replaced fragile `min(arr, default=)` with `_safe_min()`, removed `-output_path` arg.
- Fixed `src/permafrost2.c`: added `PetscOptionsInt("-flag_tIC", …)` so the flag is actually read from opts files.
- Fixed `src/initial_conditions.c`: `flag_tIC==2` (flat interface) now sets `n_actsed=0`; previously placed a large sediment slab filling the air region causing DIVERGED_STEP_REJECTED.
- Redesigned T07 (Bergeron): changed metric from undetectable ice-volume change to `tot_rhov` ratio at t=0; raised `grad_temp0` to `1e5 K/m` (ΔT=10 K, ratio=1.27). All 10 tests pass.

## 2026-04-17 — Phase-dependent mobility + 4-DOF SNES convergence fix

- Updated `MobilitySub` in `material_properties.c` from stub returning constants to `M(φ) = m₀·φ·(1−φ)` for both ice and sediment.
- In `assembly.c`: compute `mob_eff` / `mob_sed_eff` after mobility selection; split `C3` into `C3_ice` / `C3_sed` so each phase equation uses its own effective mobility in both the Laplacian and driving-force terms.
- Fixed `norm0[3]` → `norm0[4]` in `NASA_types.h` to prevent out-of-bounds writes during SNES convergence checking.
- Expanded all 3-DOF caps in `snes_convergence.c` to 4 (arrays, header, print format) so sediment (DOF 3) residuals are shown during Newton iterations.
- Extended `Integration` in `assembly.c` to return `S[6] = sed`; updated `Monitor` in `monitoring.c` to extract `tot_sed` and display a `TOT_SED` column in the time-step table.

## 2026-04-16 — Post-processing updates and bug fixes

- Updated `postprocess/analyze_interface.py`: read sediment DOF (sol[:,3]), fix air = 1−φ_i−φ_s, add sediment volume fraction to metrics and 4×2 panel plot
- Updated `postprocess/plot2D_snapshot.py`: expand `_plot_cuts` from 2×3 to 2×4 to include sediment cross-sections
- Updated `postprocess/plotpermafrost.py`: add SedPhase DOF export, fix file-exists path bug, add CLI flags
- Updated `scripts/plotpermafrost.py`: fix `❌ Error processing` bug caused by erroneous `np.newaxis` in air-phase computation
- Set up `.claude/ACTIVITY_LOG.md` and Stop hook for session logging; added activity log instruction to `CLAUDE.md`
